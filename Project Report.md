## Experiment 1
### Step 1.
We decide to generate every element of list $A^{(n)}$ with every element $A^{(n)}_i$ in the range $A^{(n)}_i \in [0, 4*n] \sub \N$.

The generated array is then sorted ascending with merge sort algorithm.


## Experiment 2

## Question 1: 
### Binary search and trinary search both fall into the O(log n) complexity class. Do your experiments show growth in execution time that is consistent with this?

## Question 2:
### Compare the total time for the two search algorithms:
### - Do they ever differ by more than 10%, or are they always within 10% of eachother?
### - Under what conditions (if any) is binary search at least 10% faster and underwhat conditions (if any) is trinary search at least 10% faster?
